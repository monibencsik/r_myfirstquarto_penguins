## Introduction

This is a first project fully executed in R with support from RStudio and Quarto.

Here, we'll look into analyzing the dimensions of Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins from the original [data set](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/).

**About the data:**

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

We gratefully acknowledge Palmer Station LTER and the US LTER Network. Special thanks to Marty Downs (Director, LTER Network Office) for help regarding the data license & use.

## Let's get the party started!

We should start with importing all necessary packages for the code, which should include tidyverse and palmerpenguins .

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

We will use the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package.

## Species

To plot the species, load the dataset and configure ggplot:

```{r}
penguins
```

Type in the glimpse command to list the available columns:

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

It seems that the columns

-   species

-   flipper_length_mm

-   body_mass_g

are exactly what we need for the visualisation!

## First plot in R!

Now that we know what we want, customise the ggplot command to visualize the scatter plot (@fig-bodymass_flipperlength_plot):

```{r}
#| label: fig-bodymass_flipperlength_plot
#| fig-cap: Scatter plot of the relationship between the body mass and the flipper length

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) 
```

## Summary

From here, we can summarise that the [Gentoo penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_penguin) are heavier and bigger, therefore their flippers are longer, whereas the [Adelie penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C3%A9lie_penguin) are smaller with short flippers.

#### Very cute!
