# Analysis of the Penguins Dataset with Tidyverse and Quarto

## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Palmer Penguins** dataset using the **Tidyverse** ecosystem in R. The analysis is rendered as an interactive HTML report using **Quarto**, an open-source scientific publishing system.

## What is Quarto?
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a next-generation, open-source publishing system for creating dynamic and reproducible documents, dashboards, presentations, and interactive reports. It supports multiple programming languages, including **R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS**. Unlike Jupyter Notebook or Flask:

- **Quarto vs. Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter is primarily an interactive computing environment suited for iterative coding and visualization, whereas Quarto is designed for structured, reproducible reporting with enhanced publishing features.
- **Quarto vs. Flask**: Flask is a web framework for building applications and APIs, while Quarto focuses on generating well-formatted documents and reports rather than building interactive web applications.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **R** and **Tidyverse** for data analysis
- **ggplot2** for data visualization
- **Quarto** for rendering reports

## Outputs
The final output is an interactive **HTML report** with visualizations, summary statistics, and insights about the penguins dataset.
